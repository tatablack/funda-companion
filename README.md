funda-companion
===============

Chrome extension to spice up the UI of www.funda.nl.
Currently limited to the "saved ads" section; while house-hunting, I needed different views on these ads, which triggered this piece of code.

Implemented features:

- Remove pagination and get hold of all ads at once
- Remove existing UI for ads listing

Planned features:
- Map view, with collapsible detail panel
- Smaller listing snippets, with a detail panel and a map
